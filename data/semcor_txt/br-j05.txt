In the over-all process , it is difficult to assign a " pure " role to each constituent of a built detergent formulation ; and , indeed , there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active , builder , antiredeposition agent , etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active .
