#18 become VERB become%2:30:00::,become%2:42:01::
Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term " teacher-employee " ( as opposed to , e. g. , " maintenance employee " ) was a not inapt description .

#26 hire VERB hire%2:41:00::
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : " Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities .

#37 become VERB become%2:30:00::,become%2:42:01::

#11 suspect VERB suspect%2:32:00::,suspect%2:32:02::
