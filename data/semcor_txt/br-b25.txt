The publication last July of the party 's Draft Program - that blueprint for the " transition to communism " - had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i. e. , since the defeat of the " anti-party group " ) in all theoretical party journals .

#26 suppose VERB suppose%2:31:00::,suppose%2:31:05::,suppose%2:32:00::
These never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of Marx and Lenin " full communism " was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a Communist society had now , under Khrushchev , become an " immediate and tangible reality " .
1
#38 become VERB become%2:30:00::,become%2:42:01::
It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in fact , very largely a rehash of that interminable document ) .

He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas , such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an " All People 's State " , and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater " democratization " of the whole hierarchy of Soviets , starting with the Supreme Soviet itself .

No doubt , there was still a lot in the Draft Program - and in Khrushchev 's speech - which left many points obscure .
1
#20 leave VERB leave%2:30:03::,leave%2:31:05::,leave%2:40:01::
Was it the party 's intention , for example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning sovkhozes , i. e. , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively " urbanized " ) ?
1
#17 replace VERB replace%2:30:00::,replace%2:40:00::,replace%2:41:00::
As we know , the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot ; and it is still very far from certain how valid the party 's claim is that in " a growing number of kolkhozes " the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm .

#67 let VERB let%2:30:01::,let%2:41:00::

It contained , for example , a number of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ; they still benefit far less than the " other " 50 per cent of the nation from that " welfare state " which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being .
2
#1 contain VERB contain%2:42:00::,contain%2:42:06::
#16 enjoy VERB enjoy%2:39:00::
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; and , though he repeated , over and over again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the " ordinary " people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how " communism " is really going to work in practice , especially in respect of food .

#11 produce VERB produce%2:29:00::,produce%2:36:00::,produce%2:36:02::
One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev 's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress - the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the " anti-party group " - Molotov , Malenkov , Kaganovich and others - including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov .

#56 include VERB include%2:31:00::,include%2:41:03::

But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated " anti-party " group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the " transition to communism " and , last but not least , on foreign policy .

Not only , as we know , did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev 's attack on Albania as " something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach " to the problem ( i. e. , as something thoroughly dictatorial and " undemocratic " ) , but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and so on .

Khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to " peaceful coexistence " and would like , above all , the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ; he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-American " honeymoon " of 1959 .
