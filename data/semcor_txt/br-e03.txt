#3 release VERB release%2:35:00::,release%2:41:00::
Nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying .

It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent 's cities and people .

#5 go VERB go%2:30:01::,go%2:42:03::,go%2:42:10::,go%2:42:12::
With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim 's people ?
1
#11 spare VERB spare%2:41:00::
The will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken .
1
#15 break VERB break%2:30:11::,break%2:35:01::,break%2:41:09::
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes .

Placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today - the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons .
2
#0 place VERB place%2:31:13::
#18 provide VERB provide%2:34:00::,provide%2:40:00::
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing .

Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us .
1
#12 appear VERB appear%2:30:00::
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other 's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us .

It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles .
1
#5 employ VERB employ%2:34:00::
If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons .
