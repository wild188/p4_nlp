With due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing , expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years , and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement , each arrow with a " shaft length " of four months or less was selected as indicating " same schedule " at Onset and Completion , for this particular epiphysis .
